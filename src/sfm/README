This directory contains the code that was used to implement the 3D
structure from motion algorithm described in

"Structure and Motion from Line Segments in Multiple Images"
by Camillo J. Taylor and David J. Kriegman. 
Center for Systems Science Technical Report No. 9402b, January 1994.

The goal of this work was to derive an algorithm that could be used to
reconstruct the 3D geometry of a rigid scene composed of a number of
straight line features using  measured line segments obtained from a set of
calibrated cameras at unknown positions. The algorithm we have
implemented recovers the positions of the features and the positions
of the cameras up to a scale factor.

*****************************************************************

Most of the files in this directory contain the code that is used to
implement the "sfm" program. This program takes as input an ASCII file
which contains the image measurements obtained from the calibrated
cameras and produces as output a binary file which contains the
results of the reconstruction procedure.

A tar file should be available on this ftp site (daneel.eng.yale.edu)
which contains a number of sample data sets on which this sfm program
can be run.

The file README.data documents the format of the input file and the
output file.

This directory also contains the file LH88.c which implements the
linear structure from motion algorithm proposed by Weng, Liu, Huang
and Ahuja in their 1988 CVPR paper. This algorithm utilizes the
LINPACK and EISPACK routines in the subdirectory
LINPACK-EISPACK-ROUTINES. These routines were downloaded from an ftp
site and converted from FORTRAN to C with the f2c program.

The file expt7.c implements a straightforward simulation experiment
which compares the performance of the linear algorithm to that of the
Taylor, Kriegman algorithm as the image noise in the data set is
increased.

*****************************************************************
 
To make the sfm program simply type 

"make sfm"

in this directory.  If you get an compilation error about ranlib,
comment out the documented line in the Makefile.

To compile expt7 you must first compile the code in the
LINPACK-EISPACK-ROUTINES subdirectory by going to that directory and
typing
 
"make svd.a"

and 

"make ev.a"

Once this has been done you can make the expt7 executable by typing

"make expt7"

in this directory.

This code has been compiled successfully on Sparcstations running
SunOS 4.1.3 and on Silicon Graphics workstations running IRIX 4.0.5
and higher.
